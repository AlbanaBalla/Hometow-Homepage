                <h3>There is enough to see and do in the city for a day or two, but the best
                thing about Durres is its location in the Adriatic sea.</h3>

            <div id="foto1">The city</div>
            <p>The coastal city of Durrësi, located a convenient 34 km from Tirana, is home to Albania’s largest port—and is one of the country’s most ancient cities. “The eternal city” over the Adriatic has a 3,000-year history, its founding dating back to 627 B.C.E. when the Corinthians and settlers from the ancient Greek city of Corcyra, situated in the island of Corfu, invaded the Illyrian territory of the Taulantii people.</p>
            <div id="foto2">The beach!</div>
            <p>Durrës is also perfect for those looking to take a break by the sea, as its sandy beaches and numerous restaurants with a stunning view of the Adriatic, make for a perfect and relaxing day trip.</p>
            <div id="foto3">Amphitheater</div>
            <p>Because of its long history, the city is naturally brimming with ancient archaeological sites and findings, including the famous amphitheater of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, whose 15,000-seats capacity make it the second biggest amphitheater in the Balkans.

            A litany of surviving objects and buildings attest to Durrës’s history: bathhouses from the 2nd century A.D., a Byzantine forum with marble columns built around the 5th-6th century, and a small 9th century church whose walls are covered with mosaics. These remnants of this past are all a short walking distance from the amphitheater.</p>
